# Echo CLI Args
A mod for EchoVR on quest to support reading in command line arguments, since the game normally does not support these.

# Installation
Install the [yodel]() modloader and drop the .so file for this mod into `/sdcard/ModData/com.readyatdawn.r15/Modloader/early_mods/`
Then your command line args you wish to use should be placed at `/sdcard/ModData/com.readyatdawn.r15/Mods/echo-cli-args/cli.txt` from where they will be read and used within the game
